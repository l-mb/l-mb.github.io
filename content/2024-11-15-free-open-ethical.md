# TL;DR

Free, Libre, and Open Source freedoms, when treated as dogma, do harm.
To truly serve our values, the "open" software community must not only
do more but differently.

# Introduction

In 2012, I spent May Day (of all days) as a speaker and attendee at the
Linux Foundation's Enterprise End User Summit in New York, hosted at the
New York Stock Exchange. On my way to the venue, we had to pass through
police cordons and, theoretically, protesters. Remember, the Occupy Wall
Street protests?

During the opening keynote, the CEO of NYSE thanked us as developers and
a community for how Linux and Open Source had been instrumental in
bringing down the cost of trades, and how this enabled trades to go from
several minutes per trade to many thousands of trades per minute and
High Frequency Trading.

I remember swallowing hard; feeling complicit. Many of us sympathized
with the protesters's perspective - yet there we were, taking
celebratory photos on the trading floor that evening, and optimizing the
machine that kept it all ticking.

What happens when the tools we created to further our freedoms end up
enabling outcomes that contradict our values?

# Why Free and Open Source Software?

I came to this community because I believed (and still do) that, given 
the importance of software in our world, our society, our daily lives, 
we must have agency. It must not be a black box to us, and we must have 
the rights to inspect, understand, and modify it.

I also believed (and still do) that, for the vast majority of all use
cases, building software collaboratively and openly (or at least having
the option to) is the most effective method for society as a whole, but
also sustainable technology and business.

We build an ever growing, ever improving public commons, fostering 
progress.

# The loss of innocence

However, I am also no longer sixteen. I've built my career on Free,
Libre, and Open Source Software; I've seen people implement
bait-and-switch schemes on licensing, CLAs, exploitative practices that
only consume and never give anything back or even undercut those who do
(the trick to get really rich in capitalism is to exploit externalities
until - if - regulation catches up with you), or pay the maintainers
peanuts or nothing. (We have all seen [the famous XKCD
comic](https://xkcd.com/2347/).)

More so, I've also seen quite a few political turns and shifts, not all
of them progressive, but more and more reactionary backlashes. I've seen
how big tech has contributed and profited from this. I know exactly who
_also_ wants big data systems.

Expecting perfect alignment on everything would, indeed, be unrealistic
and detrimental; we need _some_ resilience and elasticity in the face of
differences. With those who are somewhat neutral and where we have
complex nuanced differences of opinion and taste or reconcilable matters
of policy, sure. _The truth is rarely pure and never simple._

But I do not want my work to enable those with whom I have a truly
fundamental systemic incompatibility; such as whose personhood is valid,
whose love is valid, whose choices are valid.

# Free and Open Source Software

I still believe that Free, Libre, and Open Source Software is much more
compatible with my values than proprietary modes.

But these principles are not just the bare minimum: they actively
constrain our ability to safeguard our values.

## Unfettered, unrestricted

Because one aspect the Free Software Foundation and the Open Source 
Initiative agree on is that it must be free to use for any purpose; be 
it the _for any kind of person or organization to use it on any kind of 
computer system, for any kind of overall job and purpose_ of the [FSF's 
0th Freedom][2], or the _No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups_ 
& _6 No Discrimination Against Field of Endeavor_
of the [Open Source Definition][1].

A project that, say, allowed its use for commercial purposes only if the 
company paid all its employees at least 10% above minimum wage?
Not to be embedded in weapons of mass destruction?

Not Free Software. Not Open Source Software.

[The OSI is very, very clear on this.][7]

(It is somewhat ironic that the OSI would rather allow something to 
claim the Open Source branding despite [its sources not being made 
public][3] (for purported ethical/privacy considerations, no less!) than 
allow ethical considerations to affect the use and distribution of 
software when that might impede business. [I have written about this 
recently][4], as have many others.)

We must ask: can a freedom go too far? As seen above, the FSF and OSI
have the same answer as those who conflate freedom of speech with
freedom from accountability.

And if only it were so simple; we could focus on the nerdy intricacies
of our code and lose ourselves in a world we can control; rather than
having to consider what the tools we build enable, and whether or not we
may be accountable; if not legally, but to ourselves.

Of course, their position is limited externally already; obviously, it
does not trump applicable law. We just don't get to add additional
friction and constraints.

If, as a software developer or contributor, I can't formally forbid my
work to be used for mass murder without being excluded from the
currently largest software community, does that not strike you as
strange?

We see here a variant of the paradox of tolerance.

### Tangent: license compatibility

One reason why this is opposed is that a proliferation of terms and
conditions would make it difficult to determine whether multiple
licenses are compatible and the works can be combined in certain ways.

Everyone working on Free, Libre, Open Source software, myself included,
will concur with this. Most software engineering degrees fail to prepare
us for arguing about what is or is not a derivative work, an aggregate,
fair use, or the intricacies of how GPL, LGPL, AGPL, Apache, Mozilla,
MIT, BSD differ, often in multiple versions. I suspect many of us had
_fun_ calls with lawyers that we could have done without.

This is, however, a flimsy reason to insist on doing nothing.

Modular systems, compatibility matrices, formalizing the most common
terms are possible and, at this point, honestly would not make the
situation all that much more complicated.

## Endeavours for more ethical terms

There are already efforts to address this, such as the [Hippocratic 
License for Open Source Communities][5], which strives to align 
technology with their values and offer a modular build for your own 
terms.

Alas, their adoption suffers from the challenge that a lot of the
funding and effort flowing into the Free, Libre, and Open Source
communities is controlled by those prioritizing profits over principles.

However, not all organizations are bound by shareholder primacy, profit
maximization, or the military-surveillance complex.

Unions, cooperatives, public sector institutions, non-profits, hobbyist 
individuals or communities, and even ethically-minded businesses could 
lead the way in trialling and adopting such terms.

# Freedom of Association

However, there is something else you - we - can do: we don't have to
associate with those who endanger our values.

Most of our communities have codes of conduct and contributor guidelines
already. Let's strengthen those. Take a stand.

We have the right to refuse interactions, contributions, patches,
reports, sponsorships, or affiliations with individuals or organizations
whose values, policies, or practices irreconcilably conflict with ours.

Our ethics and values can absolutely be loud, visible, and
inconvenient.

Maybe the best choice of licensing for your project really is one that
follows the Free, Open Source tenets. Maybe you can't control the
choice. And yes, that means they could still use or fork the project.
But that doesn't mean you have got to help further. Throw some sand
into the machine.

Consider adopting ethical practices that go beyond Free, Libre, and Open
Source. Demand them from those you associate with.

Be however patient in the face of imperfection. People will try and fall
short; you, me, them. We exist in the world, and even when we change it,
change is not instant.

It should come as no surprise that this, too, is already externally
restricted via national and international law and regulations, see for
example [the Linux kernel][8]. The governments will absolutely have
their say; the idea that everyone is invited into every group is,
frankly, na√Øve.

# Free and Open Source won't save us

Free and Open Source as they are and by themselves do not lead to a
fairer world.

We need to evolve beyond those rigid and supposedly "neutral"
approaches; it is not just commercial exploitation which open-washes our
communities (and where I believe that the [Software Freedom
Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) comes out ahead in their stance
over OSI's pragmatism), but viewing software in isolation from the rest
of society would be reductionist. To insist on "neutrality" is in itself
a partisan position.

To quote the [Organization for Ethical
Source](https://ethicalsource.dev/): _The true measure of success for
open source technologies is real-world impact: how what we co-create
promotes positive social, cultural, and political change._

Everything public is politic. The only people who can "confidently" say
that technology should be kept free of politics are those privileged
enough to be safe either way; or at least believe themselves to be. And
without empathy or awareness for the others. Do not yield to their
demands of amorality.

Amorality in the face of injustice is immorality. [Technology is not
neutral][6].

Crafting perfect terms and licenses may well be impossible, but that is
no excuse for inaction. Instead, we must experiment, refine, and adopt
frameworks that align technology with our ethics.

Last week, I visited the German Museum of Technology. One exhibit is a
Hollerith tabulating machine.

Choose.
