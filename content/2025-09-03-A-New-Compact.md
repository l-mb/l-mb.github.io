## Learning about a new license

[Liam Proven](https://social.vivaldi.net/@lproven) brought the
[Baba Yaga license](https://smallandnearlysilent.com/baba-yaga/LICENSE.txt)
to my attention via [Mastodon](https://social.vivaldi.net/@lproven/115135292511567427).

(The field of endeavor and non-commercial restrictions alas will prevent this
brilliant piece of work from being widely adopted, which is a shame.)

In [an thread with Alan Cox](https://mastodon.social/@etchedpixels/115135408071881673),
he and I came up with two additional stanzas to incorporate attribution and warranty exclusions.

While I am unsure whether the original license's preamble allows mere mortals to
iterate upon it, nevertheless, here is my second edition with some tweaks.

I am very sorely tempted indeed to adopt it as the license for this website.

## The new compact

### Preamble

By ancient rites, this work is bound,  
No mortal hand may twist it 'round.

### Terms of Use

Permission granted: to mend and make,  
To copy, share, for spirit's sake.  
Yet mark: no coin, no profit gained,  
Shall taint this magic, unrestrained.  
Removed not shall all names be,  
as thou pass it onwards free.

### Disclaimer

Provided "as is," without a truth,  
No crone will blame, if ill, forsooth.  
This work is dire and scribed for fun,  
Of warranties thus I grant you none.

### Enforcement

The pact by moonlight, strongly spun,  
Binds souls if greed hath now been won.  

### Cost

The threads are spun, the spell complete,  
No greed, lest curses, you shall meet.
