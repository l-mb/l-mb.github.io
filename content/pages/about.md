# About the site

The goal of this site is to provide longer-form articles on broadly
Free, Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS) topics specifically and
Computer Science and Information Technology in general.

They might range from commentary on policy (such as Digital
Sovereignity, or FLOSS regulation), to experiences on developing FLOSS,
business, models, license choices, or operating or deploying them.

Another ambition of mine is to further my own understanding and
experiences, so notes on books, articles, papers, trainings, or my own
experiments with processes or technology are also in-scope.

Practicing the art of writing and knowledge sharing; selfishly, because
I have found there's rarely a better path to finding the gaps in your
own understanding than trying to explain it to someone else, and be that
a text document nobody else ever reads!

In contrast to my social media channels which show a wider slice of
life, this site focuses on CS/IT/FLOSS.

However, it's impossible to have a meaningful dialogue about CS/IT/FLOSS
topics *without* considering also their societal and political and
environmental implications and contexts; I consider the attempts to
"keep politics out of tech" to be deeply flawed, misguided, and
something usually only very privileged people can afford.

## Feedback appreciated!

Feedback on factual inaccuracies on this site is as appreciated as are
suggestions for further material or directions to look into. 

For public discourse, consider [my Mastodon
profile](https://mastodon.online/@larsmb) on the Fediverse.

I would like to *specifically* express my appreciation for feedback that
shows gaps in my articles as they relate to Diversity and Inclusion.
While I strive to make that a priority, I have sometimes found that - as
a non-native speaker in particular who has learned certain words as
technical terminology only - I was not aware that certain choices were
exclusionary or discriminatory.

# About Me

My name is Lars Marowsky-Br√©e, and I have been dabbling with computers
since 1988. My first true and conscious experience with Free Software
was my switch to Linux in 1994, working for an Internet Provider as a
student, and it's been my full-time career since about 1998.

Free, Libre, Open Source philosophy is one I care deeply about, more so
than proprietary software. Given how software underpins so much of our
civic infrastructure and influences our lives, I'm convinced that
proprietary software has its places; and also places where it has
absolutely no business to be chosen.

At a technical level, I'm extremely fascinated by dependability of
(distributed) systems; from low(-ish) level storage to fault tolerance
and availability of geo-scale services. The complexity of these systems
holds a strong appeal to me. While I am not inclined to go off on rants
about programming languages (which is mostly a waste of effort), the
first time I read about Rust I felt someone had finally understood the
collective PTSD C inflicts on us.

I am very much not a UI/UX person (as you perhaps can tell from the
fancy design of this site!). Give me C/Rust any day of the week, and
keep the graphical frontends away from me.

My professional life has arrived at that stage where I rarely get to
write lines of code myself, but is mostly orientated towards
architecture, processes, best practices, and providing meaningful glue
between the various business functions. Yet, I feel I remain an
engineer at heart - but it's impossible to do proper engineering without
considering the trade-offs and constraints.

I'm currently based in Berlin, use *he/they* pronouns, and besides
technology, have an obsession with food and reading way too much.

At the footer of every page, there's a plethora of ways to contact me in
case you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions about this site's
content or anything else. I'm also grateful if you let me know if
anything I wrote was actually useful to someone else!
