## Feedback appreciated!

Feedback on factual inaccuracies on this site is as appreciated as are
suggestions for further material or directions to look into. 

For public discourse, consider my social media channels.

I would like to *specifically* express my appreciation for feedback that
shows gaps in my articles as they relate to Diversity and Inclusion.
While I strive to make that a priority, I have sometimes found that - as
a non-native speaker in particular who has learned certain words as
technical terminology only - I was not aware that certain choices were
exclusionary or discriminatory.
