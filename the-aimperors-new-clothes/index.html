But I promise I'll get back to it before this blog is done, and explain why.<p>We need to overcome these tensions if we are to find a path forward. And we must, since LLMs and generative AI <em>exist</em>, are part of our shared reality, seen to be shiny by some (for various reasons), and (for complex reasons) get added to quite literally everything.<p>As a profession, we owe it to our users, customers, and community members to do better.<h3 id=denial-is-not-a-strategy><a aria-label="Anchor link for: denial-is-not-a-strategy" class=zola-anchor href=#denial-is-not-a-strategy>Denial is not a strategy</a></h3><p>I will start by first talking to the side I feel most closely aligned with: those of us who are critical of GenAI and LLMs in particular. (I'll mostly limit myself to LLMs here; while I believe the general thoughts apply more broadly, I'm not as familiar.)<p>Denigrating all use of generative AI as pointless is not constructive, nor credible.<p>Why?<p><strong>Because it's a claim that flies in the face of the lived experience of everyone who has ever sincerely experimented with it.</strong><p>Everyone who has done so (and taken at least a wee bit of time to get familiar with a new and different tool) will have found scenarios where LLMs are mind-blowing in comparison to what we had before.<p>For breaking through the "staring at a blank page" stage of any sort of project, translations (of both human and programming languages, and even between those two domains), a thesaurus and brain-storming tool with no equal (except maybe the trusty rubber duck), approximate summarization, proximity search, providing feedback on tone and not just syntax, to, yes, "vibe coding" of random prototypes for whatever, the list goes on: it can be both useful <em>and</em> fun.<p>Speaking of software engineering, seasoned professional engineers I highly respect and personally know report impressive results (with, yes, caveats; we'll get to those). It would be hubris to dismiss all of their insights.<h4 id=learning-curve><a aria-label="Anchor link for: learning-curve" class=zola-anchor href=#learning-curve>Learning curve</a></h4><p>And no, not all examples where LLMs generate bad responses are constructive. You have to take how the tool works into account when you use it.<p>Yes, I also laugh when they seemingly can't count the number of occurrences of the letter "r" in the word "strawberry".<p>This is only a good example if you pair it with <a href=https://www.runpod.io/blog/llm-tokenization-limitations rel=noopener target=_blank>an explanation as to <em>why</em></a>, and how to <a href=https://deepgains.substack.com/p/why-do-llms-struggle-with-counting rel=noopener target=_blank>wield the tool to actually achieve the goal</a>: ask it to write a python script to do it; it can probably write MMIX better than you.<p>If you stop at laughing, folks will assume you've never tried in earnest.<p>If you can't at least hold the tool right, people will dismiss your opinion; that's not a credible position to argue from.<h4 id=perfection-is-overrated-sometimes><a aria-label="Anchor link for: perfection-is-overrated-sometimes" class=zola-anchor href=#perfection-is-overrated-sometimes>Perfection is overrated (sometimes)</a></h4><p>Not all scenarios need perfection. The LLM may generate a response you wouldn't merge or write yourself; doesn't mean it's not useful in the cases it does successfully one-shot an acceptable answer, possibly with some polishing or minimal re-prompting.<p>And especially to users who have a scenario where long-term maintainability or even performance is perhaps a secondary concern, it is more useful to have a working answer than a better one.<p>AI may not raise the ceiling, but it does raise the floor. And there is value in that.<h4 id=let-s-admit-it><a aria-label="Anchor link for: let-s-admit-it" class=zola-anchor href=#let-s-admit-it>Let's admit it</a></h4><p>Sorry, but you can't tell me it is not technically rather amazing what we can achieve with what is, at the heart of it, probabilistic text transformation with a pinch of Lady Luck.<p>Plus, as an engineer, I find the sheer scale of the deployments and operations incredible.<h4 id=acknowledge-people-s-experience><a aria-label="Anchor link for: acknowledge-people-s-experience" class=zola-anchor href=#acknowledge-people-s-experience>Acknowledge people's experience</a></h4><p>If you want to reach people, you have to acknowledge this instead of denying it; rejecting it entirely means you are easy to dismiss. That is not the way to a constructive discourse.<p>Only if you — we — are also honest about what the LLMs <em>can</em> do will we be taken seriously and be credible when we discuss their limits and constraints.<h3 id=on-the-other-hand><a aria-label="Anchor link for: on-the-other-hand" class=zola-anchor href=#on-the-other-hand>On the other hand ...</a></h3><p>On the other hand, every expert who has, in their field, sincerely experimented with LLMs also knows they have severe limitations.<p>And we must be honest about those if we want to model LLMs appropriately in our minds (instead of falling into the trap of anthropomorphizing them), which is a pre-requisite to using them where they make sense, and make sensible use of their outputs. And avoiding their use where they are not the right tool for the job.<p>Honestly? I'd not know where to start with my own anecdotes regarding that. I have so many.<h4 id=our-intuition-fails-us><a aria-label="Anchor link for: our-intuition-fails-us" class=zola-anchor href=#our-intuition-fails-us>Our intuition fails us</a></h4><p>And I am not surprised, because I (at the most high-level, admittedly) understand how they work. And I understand why many people who are not themselves tech experts do not grasp this well.<p>We all (except for the youngest of us) have some intuition about what computers are good at:<ul><li>they do math fast and correctly,<li>they can retrieve factual data from large sets,<li>they are reliable,<li>they produce reproducible outcomes.</ul><p>Once you got a response, barring bugs, you could likely trust it.<p>LLMs <em>fail</em> at all of these, and largely don't do any of this when you throw them a prompt. (Yes, Retrieval-Augmented Generation non-withstanding.)<p>They are not fast. They do not look-up facts. They are not databases. They are not reliable. And they are so non-reproducible that Monte Carlo multi-shot (give the problem to LLMs multiple times, hoping one answer is good enough) is a viable tactic. You can't trust the response.<p>Clearly, at the very least, this requires a period of adjustment, combined with honest education and training: the outputs from these tools need to be treated quite differently. Both of which most of us were not given before being exposed to it.<p>And their generated responses sound very plausible and confident; because that is what they were trained on. Few people write and publish content when they are severely doubting themselves.<p>This is likely obvious to you if you found your way to my blog; but it is <em>not</em> obvious to society at large, still.<h4 id=the-limitations-are-glaring><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-limitations-are-glaring" class=zola-anchor href=#the-limitations-are-glaring>The limitations are glaring</a></h4><p>At the time of this writing, even the latest and expensive "frontier" models available, such as provided by OpenAI or Claude.ai, "fail" in fairly spectacular ways that no human would, unless severely incapacitated.<h4 id=hallucination-is-a-euphemism><a aria-label="Anchor link for: hallucination-is-a-euphemism" class=zola-anchor href=#hallucination-is-a-euphemism>Hallucination is a Euphemism</a></h4><p>LLMs are non-reproducible as a fundamental design choice, since some amount of randomness is part of their inference process. This can be useful for brain storming, but also means that - from the point of view of a user - they occasionally "invent" stuff that doesn't exist.<p>LLMs "hallucinate" facts, citations, and references because it is likely that such sources would exist and be cited by a human. This is somewhat well-known by now.<p>But the opposite also happens: they hallucinate the <em>absence</em> of information when they don't fully and/or accurately incorporate the sources used into their contexts.<p>For example, when Claude.ai's Opus 4 (an expensive to train and expensive to use model with extended thinking and "deep research" enabled) "report" in response to a fairly well-crafted prompt asking about a product's specification includes a long explanation that it couldn't find the required facts to answer the question, claiming to have "extensively" researched the official channels, technical forums, etc (stating to have incorporated <strong>541</strong> sources), and then proceeds from that assumption to generate the rest of the response —<p>This <em>might</em> be reasonable and certainly reads as such, right? It researched way more sources than any human would have.<p>However: the "missing" detail was clearly part of the very product page provided as part of the prompt itself.<p>Yes, that should not be surprising if you understand their constraints.<p>But that's not hallucination, either.<p>From the perspective of the user, that is <strong>failure</strong>.<p>Yes. This is not a good use case for LLMs; but it is one they are explicitly marketed for. I cringe whenever I see someone suggest to query an LLM for facts or research. (Unless, of course, they really cross-check all assumptions, which experience with even university-grade work suggests is not going to happen.)<h4 id=the-anthropomorphization-trap><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-anthropomorphization-trap" class=zola-anchor href=#the-anthropomorphization-trap>The Anthropomorphization Trap</a></h4><p>Since the models present as human language conversation, humans tend to assume they behave similarly to how a human would.<p>e.g., when we correct them, they apologize and produce a different response. Humans even go so far as assuming the model was "testing" them with its errors to see if they were paying attention.<p>We might assume that they are confident when their language sounds confident. We ascribe intent, even emotions, based on the generated outputs. We fall for it when it congratulates us or pays our prompt a compliment.<p>Of course, none of that is true. But it is very difficult to talk to LLMs without using such language, and without falling into the trap of using mental models of humans to relate to the LLMs.<p>(People go as far as threatening them to get supposedly better outputs; which, honestly, <em>if</em> those people assume they do indeed have emotions affecting their results, is pretty screwed up.)<h4 id=if-everything-you-have-is-an-llm><a aria-label="Anchor link for: if-everything-you-have-is-an-llm" class=zola-anchor href=#if-everything-you-have-is-an-llm>If everything you have is an LLM ...</a></h4><p>... then everything must become a conversation.<p>This is why even my bank's very reasonable request for me to check my contact details suggests only the path of "ask our chat bot for your address and chat with it to correct it if needed" — instead of just pointing me at a simple form to click "OK" on.<p>(I will allow that some people prefer conversation over other forms of interactions, regardless of efficiency, but we see this shoved into every system at the cost of the other approaches.)<p>LLMs are now used for everything, even when they're not the best answer we have. Be it a database look-up or even different forms of ML/AI, all the attention is on LLMs.<p>Due to similar dynamics, they are used to hide problems that should be addressed at the root cause. By all means, use an LLM for heuristic search for your documentation — but don't use the LLM to provide the answer (with possible corruption). Instead fix your docs to be better! (Ironically, this will make your product better to interact with by LLMs ...)<h4 id=and-the-operators-know><a aria-label="Anchor link for: and-the-operators-know" class=zola-anchor href=#and-the-operators-know>And the operators know</a></h4><p>Support chats now almost always include the disclaimer of "this is an AI model. It can make mistakes.".<p>When I reach out to support, I want a correct answer. Or at least one I can hold the company who I'm in contact with to account for.<p><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dont-direct-your-users-chat-bots-support-lars-marowsky-br%C3%A9e-pcgoe/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Over on LinkedIn I have argued that this is another case of holding the tool wrong</a> and that it should be done better and how.<p>But the current common approach is simply infuriating: it focuses only on cost reduction for the provider, at the expense of the consumer. and not on better outcomes for the consumer.<h4 id=facts><a aria-label="Anchor link for: facts" class=zola-anchor href=#facts>Facts?</a></h4><p>You have to double-check every thing the generated response claims, because you only get back a statistically likely answer relative to the data the system was trained on, plus some intentional randomness. Not facts the system looked up in response to your query.<p>This may be particularly annoying to people in whose work and interests facts and all details very much do matter. And if I may be so snarky, I think a lot of the LLM hype is generated by people who operate in spheres where the shared reality is more subject to negotiation.<p>The same is pretty much true for most other (generative) AI use cases, from image generation to text transcripts and voice: that they appear plausible to casual human inspection is not the same thing as them being <em>correct</em>.<h4 id=not-fit-for-purpose><a aria-label="Anchor link for: not-fit-for-purpose" class=zola-anchor href=#not-fit-for-purpose>Not Fit For Purpose</a></h4><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: the models are <strong>not</strong> fit for the purposes they're marketed and sold for.<p>And we have no known strategy to overcome these limitations.<p>Because GPTs and LLMs have suddenly developed these apparent capabilities at a certain complexity and scale, our answer mostly consists of throwing more scale at the limits, and crossing our fingers.<p>We have collectively sunk trillions into this. And while this yields improvements, the systems keep generating vastly incorrect and incomplete responses.<p>That is not the same as saying they are not useful; I kindly refer back to the first part of this writing. And yet, there is an inflated presentation that they do not deliver on.<p>They are an open research problem. The strategy might exist. But it might not.<h2 id=the-elephant-in-the-room><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-elephant-in-the-room" class=zola-anchor href=#the-elephant-in-the-room>The Elephant in the room</a></h2><p>Let's come back to the elephant in the room: the harm.<ul><li>Generative AI incurs massive environmental costs.<li>A lot of the labelling is done by underpaid and exploited workers.<li>A lot of the content they're trained can only be considered IP theft (and <em>would</em> be, if it wasn't done by billionaires).<li>They are trained to read like confidence tricksters.<li>For Cloud-based Generative AI, the usual privacy concerns apply.<li>Generative AI is marketed with dishonest, exaggerated claims.<li>It's often pushed with the goals of wage suppression, de-skilling, and lay-offs.<li>LLMs reproduce and thus perpetuate biases inherent in their training data and labeling.<li>As a consequence, they also are bad at generating output of higher quality than their inputs; much the opposite.<li>The inability to filter Generative AI outputs from future inputs will likely lead to model collapse.<li>The way how they present their output as "human" language actively undermines our ability to not anthropomorphize them and maintain sensible mental models.<li>Generative AI is used in ways that can only be described as massive denial-of-service attacks against our collective minds and society.</ul><p>Yes, I agree. These and more are excellent reasons to oppose the use of most generative AI.<p>And yet, only some of these problems <em>are</em> immediately (and not just several quarters in the future) applicable to a business today.<p>The problem with raising the rest?<p>They are appeals to morality, ethics, or external costs.<p>These only ever matter to businesses when politics creates policies and regulations that are actually enforced by the judiciary and executive.<p>But if you make any of these arguments to a leader in <em>business</em>, they'll shrug, even if they agree, if it looks like they create more profits for their shareholders with fewer pesky humans in the loop. Humans mean wages, social security payments, overhead costs. Of course they prefer automation.<p>I respect that this is why you chose to not learn how to hold the tool. But then be clear about this; make moral arguments if your argument is moral, don't claim the tool doesn't and/or can't work.<p>Note that Luddites were not opposed to progress as such; the arguments brought forth against all criticism of Generative AI have similarities with the campaigns against Luddism.<p>Further note that, somehow, GenAI and LLMs are almost always brought up as tools to reduce the staffing needs for employees and individual contributors; rarely for the CxO level.<h3 id=systemic-action-is-needed><a aria-label="Anchor link for: systemic-action-is-needed" class=zola-anchor href=#systemic-action-is-needed>Systemic Action is needed</a></h3><p>These are arguments you need to make to politicians and as part of your labour unions.<p>At a business level, even an individual, these have insufficient traction. Neither individuals nor organizations are good enough™ for this. And a few individuals or even organizations changing their minds also has too little impact. We must address them systemically.<p>These harms are not inherent to LLMs per se. They are inherent to LLMs <em>driven by shareholder-first capitalism in the pre-regulation rush</em>.<p>And it works! See the EU AI Act, and even the OSI AI Definition (as much as I criticize it). Regulation is always slower than the unrestrained gold rush. But it will catch up; we've seen this before. Let's give it a push, together.<h3 id=the-genie-is-out-of-the-bottle><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-genie-is-out-of-the-bottle" class=zola-anchor href=#the-genie-is-out-of-the-bottle>The genie is out of the bottle</a></h3><p>At the same time, I believe it is impossible to put the genie back into the bottle. Yes, all these harms are real and horrible. And yet.<p>If knowing that was enough, most planes would be scrapped. There would be no cars with ICE. Coal and gas power plants would have been shut off three decades ago.<p>There is no going back. LLMs will be around, even if folks realize their limits. Because they <em>are</em> useful.<p>We need them to be ethical and sustainable.<h2 id=is-the-aimperor-naked><a aria-label="Anchor link for: is-the-aimperor-naked" class=zola-anchor href=#is-the-aimperor-naked>Is the AImperor naked?</a></h2><p><em>No, the emperor is not naked.</em><p>We must acknowledge this if we want to have a meaningful conversation. I found myself too frequently annoyed with the reductionist and dismissive position taken by some critics.<p>But.<p><em>The emperor is wearing bloodied rags.</em><p>We must acknowledge this if we want to move forward. As you can probably tell, my position isn't quite neutral. But our criticism needs to be constructive, credible, and framed appropriately for our target audience to have impact.<h2 id=quo-vadis><a aria-label="Anchor link for: quo-vadis" class=zola-anchor href=#quo-vadis>Quo vadis?</a></h2><p>This leaves us, and especially my own industry, in a risky quandary.<p>While useful, I have doubts that what these models can actually achieve and deliver is worth their current level of investment.<p>Much less so if we do eventually end up factoring in what the vendors currently get to consider "external costs" through regulation.<h3 id=the-optimists-could-be-right><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-optimists-could-be-right" class=zola-anchor href=#the-optimists-could-be-right>The optimists could be right</a></h3><p>There is, of course, a nonzero chance that someone does find the holy grail - not for "General Purpose AI", but just merely, you know, for generative AI that doesn't make stuff up; or at least at a statistically irrelevant level. A new algorithm, a new magic scale threshold.<h3 id=or-else><a aria-label="Anchor link for: or-else" class=zola-anchor href=#or-else>Or else?</a></h3><p>Should this fail to occur in the short- or mid-term, I suspect the bubble will collapse <strong>spectacularly</strong>.

It all went great — right until it didn't.<p>Right now, nobody in the industry can afford for this to happen.<p>Just like the real-estate-investors need Return-to-Office mandates so the value of their office spaces doesn't collapse and make the subprime crisis look tame, all the large investors in the tech world need us to shove LLMs into everything to keep expanding; and pretend, hope, pray that there is a path to success — and that we will find it.<p>There's a reason "AI" features are now in everything, beyond the people actually believing the claims: the industry needs to show increasing user counts. <em>Or else.</em><h3 id=so-what-will-happen><a aria-label="Anchor link for: so-what-will-happen" class=zola-anchor href=#so-what-will-happen>So what will happen?</a></h3><p>My best guess? LLMs will still be around in a decade or two, and we'll all use them for what they can do, with varying levels of quality of product. (And yes, people will still oversell them, just like with everything else.)<p>But <em>somewhen</em> between then and today, there'll be a supremely uncomfortable half-decade or so.<p>LLMs are neither useless nor magical. They succeed at certain tasks but fail spectacularly at others. The problem isn't the technology but shareholder capitalism without adequate regulation.<h2 id=and-until-then><a aria-label="Anchor link for: and-until-then" class=zola-anchor href=#and-until-then>And until then?</a></h2><p>Until then, let's do our best. Perhaps limit their use, as far as your job permits. Don't hate yourself or others if you decide that to stay competitive, you have no choice. Be mindful. Strive to maintain an appropriate mental model of the tool. Use the more ethical options. Not everything can be offset entirely, but donate to the restoration of swamps and other offsetting approaches. Donate to educational charities to raise awareness. Advocate for ethical and sustainable approaches. Write to your legislators and regulators (policy proposals are beyond the scope of this article). Have meaningful conversations with your corporate leadership about how to lower costs <em>and</em> improve quality. Be realistic about what you can achieve if they are owned by investors that are also owning AI companies. Unionize. Don't guilt-trip folks who use them, but educate them from a position of understanding.

And how little we value these properties in general.<p>This insight depresses me, but alas, it rings plausible.<p>This would continue to undermine our shared reality and trust (since too often, multiple people asking the same question would generate different responses), and continue the erosion of quality.<p>I hope we'd still see improvements in the tools to the point where this is at least less of a problem.<p>It might also lead to a further stratification of knowledge and tech use; similar to how we have different qualities of many other products available at different price points.<p>There is also a reasonably straightforward fix to prevent the worst: <strong>product liability for the generated responses</strong> (that can't simply be subverted by adding "use at your own risk" disclaimers).<p>While it might not matter that the bot got someone's birthday wrong, I've had the chat bot suggest that it would be a "fun experiment" to use my <a href=https://9barista.com/ rel=noopener target=_blank>espresso maker</a> for pressure extraction of vegetables (which, in technical terms, we call a "bomb"); without any such caveats and response to an innocent prompt.<p>And similarly, if a company offers a chat bot as a support tool, the company <em>should</em> be held liable and accountable for what that tool recommends.<p>Regulation and enforcement thereof is key.<h2 id=2025-08-04><a aria-label="Anchor link for: 2025-08-04" class=zola-anchor href=#2025-08-04>2025-08-04</a></h2><p>Cleaned up (hopefully) the example on "negative" hallucinations.<p>Added the Anthropomorphization Trap section.<nav><div><a href=https://opensourcerer.eu/a-new-compact/>‹ A New Compact</a></div><div><a href=https://opensourcerer.eu/free-open-ethical/> Free, Libre, Open - Ethical? ›</a></div></nav></article></main><footer><hr><div class=c><nav class=tpad><div><a title="OpenSourcerer.eu Atom Feed" href=https://opensourcerer.eu/atom.xml target=_blank type=application/atom+xml><i class="svg rss" title="OpenSourcerer.eu Atom Feed" type=Button></i></a><a class="js m-protected" href=#bGFyc0BtYXJvd3NreS1icmVlLmV1 target=_blank title=Mail><i class="svg mail" title=Mail type=Button></i></a><a href=https://mastodon.online/@larsmb rel=me target=_blank title=Mastodon><i class="svg mastodon" title=Mastodon type=Button></i></a><a href=https://matrix.to/#/@l_mb:matrix.org/ target=_blank title=Matrix><i class="svg matrix" title=Matrix type=Button></i></a><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/larsmb/ target=_blank title=LinkedIn><i class="svg linkedin" title=LinkedIn type=Button></i></a><a href=https://github.com/l-mb/ target=_blank title=Github><i class="svg github" title=Github type=Button></i></a></div></nav><nav class=vpad><a class="rpad s90" href=https://opensourcerer.eu/privacy/> Privacy </a><a class="rpad s90" href=https://opensourcerer.eu/license/> License </a><a class="rpad s90" href=https://github.com/l-mb/l-mb.github.io/ target=_blank> GitHub </a><a class="rpad s90" href=https://opensourcerer.eu/sitemap.xml target=_blank> Sitemap </a></nav><p class=s80>© <span id=year>2026</span> Lars Marowsky-Brée • Website content is licensed <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/ rel=noopener target=_blank>CC BY NC SA 4.0</a>.</div></footer><span class=topout> <span class=topleft> </span><a title="Back to Top" class=top href=#><i class="svgs svgh angu"></i></a> </span>
